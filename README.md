# town-builder-proto

Something that I cooked up while I was working in Street Lamp Games and during my internship, I made good progress. So, this is basically a Town Building Prototype game made with Unity 3D. 

Check when: 
1. We increase or plop the houses, roads etc the current money decreases.
2. If we don't have any farms but many houses, then food will decrease and the population will decrease 
3. If we do install farms and houses, the food and population will start increasing its threshold capacity 4. Factories increase jobs
